# MaskLOL

Jupyter [notebook](total_mask_mass.ipynb) extrapolating mask usage and the required mass.  

Wearing one mask was recommend in 2020 CE to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In early 2021, that recommendation was increased to two masks.  This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which graphs the expected number of masks per person, and the total mass of all masks, assuming that the recommended number of masks per person continues to double each year, extrapolated to the year 2100.  Mass is compared to that of Earth, Jupiter (the planet, not to be confused with Jupyter, the notebook software), and Earth's Sun.  A log scale is used for the vertical axis.

![Log plot of mask number and total mass, if number of masks per person doubles every year.  Mask number and mass are straight and parallel, going up to the right.  Circa 2070, mask mass crosses mass of Earth. Circa 2080, mask mass crosses mass of Jupiter.   Circa 2090, mass of the Sun.](/total_mask_mass.png?raw=true "Log plot of mask number and total mass, if number of masks per person doubles every year.
